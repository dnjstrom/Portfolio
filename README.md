Portfolio
=========

This is the code for my awesome portfolio site. It's built for html5 using modern tooling such as yeoman and varius preprocessors (i.e. stylus, coffeescript, jade).


Development setup
-----------------
First, install nodejs+npm in whatever way suits your system. 

Next run:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

to install the yeoman suite globally on your computer.

Finally run these commands to setup to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install      # Installs project dependencies
bower install    # Installs bower components
```

When you're ready to hack away run:

```bash
grunt serve
```

to start a server with live reloading.
