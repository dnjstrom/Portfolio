Portfolio
=========

This is the code for my awesome portfolio site. It's built for html5 using modern tooling such as yeoman and varius preprocessors (i.e. stylus, coffeescript, jade).


Development setup
-----------------
First, install nodejs+npm in whatever way suits your system. 

Next run:

    npm install -g yo

to install the yeoman suite globally on your computer.

Finally run these commands to setup to install all dependencies:

		npm install      # Installs project dependencies
    bower install    # Installs bower components
